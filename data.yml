  - description: Afterlive (A Fourier-based Tool in the Electrostatic limit for the Rapid Low-noise Integration of the Vlasov Equation) allows for a fast simulation of electromagnetic plasmas. It uses a hybrid method between a gridded Eulerian description and Lagrangian meta-particles, reconstructing the distribution function f in every time step for each species. This interpolation method combines meta-particles with different weights in such a way that particles with large weight do not drown out particles that represent small contributions to the phase space density. These core properties allow the use of a much larger range of macro factors and can thus represent a much larger dynamic range in phase space density.

  - description: Rotamerically Induced Perturbations with Langevin dynamics (L-RIP) and Rotamerically Induced Perturbations of a pseudo-Ligand (RIPlig) are two non-equilibrium MD approaches aimed at an identification of slow conformational changes of a binding site. They are an extention of the Rotamerically Induced Perturbation (RIP) MD approach, which employs perturbation of side-chain torsional motion for initiating large-scale protein movement. RIP enables protein flexibility that normally occurs on the microsecond or longer time scale (for example, distortion of secondary and tertiary structure) to be explored. In Langevin-RIP (L-RIP) approach perturbation is applied to the side chains of the binding site residues, but the original RIP procedure is modified by using a Langevin thermostat in the simulations instead of the original constant-energy conditions. This ensures that the average protein temperature is preserved during the MD simulations. Additionally, the friction term enables the elements of the protein structure with fast relaxation times to equilibrate within each perturbation pulse. This makes it possible to increase the number of pulses and, thus, enhance sampling of slow conformational variations. In RIPlig, the perturbation procedure is applied not to each protein residue, but to an artificial molecule placed in the binding pocket with repetitions starting with different positions of the molecule, which enables flexible regions of the binding site to be identified in a small number of MD simulations of several picoseconds duration.

  - description: py4dgeo is a C++ library with Python bindings for change analysis in multitemporal and 4D point clouds. Topographic 3D/4D point clouds are omnipresent in geosciences, environmental, ecological and archaeological sciences, robotics, and many more fields and applications. Technology to capture such data using laser scanning and photogrammetric techniques have evolved into standard tools. Dense time series of topographic point clouds are becoming increasing available and require tools for automatic analysis. Moreover, methods considering the full 4D (3D space + time) data are being developed in research and need to be made available in an accessible way with flexible integration into existent workflows.

  - description: pytreedb is a Python software package providing an object-based library to provide a simple database interface and REST API of vegetation tree objects that were captured as 3D point clouds. The main objective is to provide a Python library for the storage and sharing of single tree-based point clouds and all relevant (forest inventory) tree measurements. The tree data include all tree related information, measurements, metadata, geoinformation and also links to the 3D point clouds linked in any file format (e.g. LAS/LAZ). GeoJSON including all tree-related information is used as data format for data exchange and visualization with other software (e.g. direct import into most GIS). Thereby view and modification of the tree datasets (*.geojson) is straightforward.

  - description: SYCAMORE is a system that provides you with a facilitated access to a number of tools and methods in order to build models of biochemical systems, view, analyse and refine them, as well as perform quick simulations. SYCAMORE is not intended to substitute for expert simulation and modeling software packages, but might interact with those. It is rather intended to support and guide system biologists when doing computational research. One important function of SYCAMORE is to allow you to build a draft model of your system of interest in such a way that kinetic expressions and parameters are as close to reality as possible. We want to emphasize that the resulting model still has a draft character and should not be taken as "the final model". However, setting up your model in such a way that parameters etc. are as close to reality as possible on the basis of literature data and computational parameter estimation methods should faciliate any parameter fitting methods that you want to employ later on.

It aims to combine a symbolic regression base with the extensions required to work with often strongly scattered experimental data, different residual pre- and post-processing options, and additional features required to consider thermodynamic equations of state development. The project and the code are a work-in-progress and there are many more features planned.

  - description: TRAnsient Pockets in Proteins with Druggability Calculation allows analysis of transient binding pockets and druggability indices in proteins. The TRAPP webserver, and the downloadable command line version, is intended to aid the discovery of ligands that bind in transient subpockets in proteins. The TRAPP webserver offers a range of tools to explore binding site motions ranging from local side chain fluctuations to global backbone motions; analysis of the binding site dynamics in simulated protein motion trajectories or trajectories provided by the user; a tool for tracking, analysis and visualization of protein cavity dynamics in an ensemble of protein structures or in protein trajectories; detection of transient pockets and subpockets that may appear due to protein motion; combined analysis of the protein sequence conservation and the variations of the physicochemical properties of a binding pocket; assessment of the binding pocket druggability and its variation in simulated trajectories and visualization of the pocket regions that favorably contribute to the pocket druggability. TRAPP is not designed to identify all of a protein's binding pockets, but rather to trace changes in the spatial and physicochemical properties of a specified pocket in a protein that may arise due to the protein's flexibility.

  - description: UNICORN uses a spatially resolved simulation area in which an Active Galactic Nuclei jet is divided into disks along its axis. In each disc, a photon population and a forward and a backward electron and proton population are considered. These move along the jet axis by advection. In parallel, a given velocity profile of the background plasma is considered. After a certain time, due to the scattering of this plasma, an equilibrium is established between the particles moving forward and backward. For a shock in the background plasma, there is then a direct Fermi-I acceleration in the model.
